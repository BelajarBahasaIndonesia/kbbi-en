If you are unhappy with the files, you can delete:
term_bank_100.json to 125 : Contain automatically resolved base words, might be dirty. Usually will be helpful although not 100% reliable, but you can delete if you are low on space.
term_meta_bank_1.json : I abused Yomitan's formatting to put pronounciation to "freq" because I really like that location, but this file is absolutely not necessary if you don't like the pronounciation appearing in the lime text box. (Note: I won't help you move the pronounciation to another location if you delete this file)
